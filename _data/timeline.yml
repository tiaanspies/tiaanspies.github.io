- title: Systems Integration and Test Engineer, ASML, USA
  from: 2023
  to: present
  description: As a Systems Integration and Test Engineer at ASML,
    I work on the cutting-edge High-NA lithography system—one of the most complex machines ever developed. 
    Recently introduced to the market, this technology is driving the next generation of semiconductor advancements.<br><br>

    In my role, I analyze and resolve production and system integration challenges, ensuring the industrialization and 
    scalability of these advanced machines. Using tools like Python and MATLAB, I collect and interpret data to diagnose issues,
    while occationally providing hands on electrical support for issues escalated by the production team.<br><br>

    By applying structured problem-solving methodologies and cross-disciplinary expertise, I contribute to enhancing system stability, 
    optimizing performance, and ensuring seamless production readiness.

- title: Research internship, Robot Swarm Path Planning, BU, USA
  from: Summer 2023
  description: During my research internship at Boston University, I developed and implemented a path planning algorithm 
    for a mobile robot swarm, enabling coordinated navigation while avoiding collisions with obstacles and other robots. 
    Using ROS as the communication framework, I designed a decentralized system for multi-robot coordination and control.<br><br>

    This project strengthened my expertise in swarm robotics, path planning, and ROS programming, while also providing 
    hands-on experience with embedded systems and C programming. The robots were powered by ESP32 microcontrollers running Micro-ROS, further expanding my skills in real-time control and distributed systems.

- title: Controls Engineer, Schullpak, South Africa
  from: 2021
  to: 2022
  description: As a Controls Engineer at Schullpak, I was responsible for designing and implementing control systems for high-speed 
    packaging machinery, ensuring efficient and reliable operation. I developed and maintained PLC programs and HMI interfaces, 
    optimizing automation for major clients such as Coca-Cola and Heineken.<br><br>

    One of my key projects was serving as the lead programmer for a $400,000 robotic palletizer upgrade, where I designed, 
    programmed, and successfully completed Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) for a new PLC system. This end-to-end project 
    reinforced my ability to take complex automation solutions from design to implementation, strengthening my expertise in 
    industrial robotics and control systems.

- title: Bachelor of Engineering in Mechatronics (Cum Laude), Stellenbosch University, South Africa
  from: 2018
  to: 2021
  description: My undergraduate studies in Mechatronics Engineering provided a strong foundation in electrical and mechanical engineering, 
    forming the basis for my career in robotics and automation. This interdisciplinary education equipped me with essential skills in 
    control systems, embedded programming, and automation technologies.<br><br>

    I graduated Cum Laude with a 3.83 GPA and was recognized for academic excellence by being invited to join the Golden Key 
    International Honour Society, awarded to the top 15% of students in my class.
