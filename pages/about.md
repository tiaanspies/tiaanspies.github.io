# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
With a background in mechatronics and robotics, I specialize in designing and integrating intelligent
systems that bridge the gap between software and hardware. I am fluent in everything from Robot Kinematics to Computer Vision. 
My passion lies in solving complex engineering challenges, optimizing automation processes, and advancing the capabilities of robotic systems.

Currently, I work at ASML, contributing to the development of next-generation high-NA 
lithography machinesâ€”pushing the boundaries of precision engineering and semiconductor technology.
